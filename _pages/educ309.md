### Description
In this upper-level undergraduate seminar, our primary goal is to work as a team to strengthen our skills in basic qualitative and quantitative research on race, class, and educational policy. We will closely read studies by other authors, then design and conduct our own small-scale research projects, and publicly present our findings. Our theme for Fall 2019 is "Researching Trinity and Hartford."

### Our Research Projects
We will conduct interviews with a stratified random sample of Trinity students to ask:

1. How do perceptions and experiences of Hartford vary among first-year Trinity students of different racial, social class, and gender backgrounds?

2. How do perceptions and experiences of race and social class at Trinity vary among first-year students of different backgrounds?

In addition, for the Community Learning component of this course, we will attend Hartford neighborhood group meetings to share the results of a recent door-to-door survey on how community residents perceive and experience Trinity College, and listen to how participants respond to this study.

### Requirements
Students must bring a copy of this book, print or digital, for a close reading of the text in class and discussion with the author:

  Anthony Abraham Jack, *The Privileged Poor: How Elite Colleges Are Failing Disadvantaged Students* (Harvard University Press, 2019), <https://books.google.com/books?id=Gv6EDwAAQBAJ>.

Photocopies of additional readings will be made available to students for $10 fee.

Each student must bring a laptop to each class session for writing, editing, and data analysis. Contact me if you need to borrow a spare laptop.
