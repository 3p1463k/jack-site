  * Homework Help
  * Math & Reading Enrichment
  * Conflict Resolution
  * Global Citizenship
  * Physical Education
  * Creative & Performing Arts

Our program runs Mondays through Thursdays during Trinity’s academic calendar year.  Program hours are 3:30 P.M. to 6:00 P.M.  Mentoring positions are **paid** (minimum two-day commitment).  Flexible, non-paid volunteer Mentor positions are also available.

> I like this program because of the activities and games. I also like the fun spirited counselors and the new friends you could make and have to talk with. If you need help with your homework you could get a helping hand from your great counselor when needed. —Charity, 4th Grade
