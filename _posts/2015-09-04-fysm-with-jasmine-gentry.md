Today I came back to full-time teaching at Trinity College, and what made this day extra special was working with Jasmine Gentry &#8217;17, the mentor for our first-year seminar on [Color & Money: Race and Social Class at Trinity and Beyond](http://commons.trincoll.edu/colorandmoney). While students read the first book (Mitchell Steven&#8217;s _Creating a Class_, an ethnography of the college admissions and financial aid process at a liberal arts college), they engage in [a role-playing simulation](http://commons.trincoll.edu/colorandmoney/simulation/) as admissions officers who must accept or reject 15 applicants to their hypothetical college. During the simulation, Jasmine&#8217;s role is the Associate Dean of Admissions, and I&#8217;m her administrative assistant. Today she stepped up to the plate to engage our crew with their first assignment. It&#8217;s always a thrill to see younger people take charge of their learning. So I kept my mouth shut for a few minutes and took this photo. Follow our simulation &#8212; and watch out for some interesting plot twists to come &#8212; at <http://commons.trincoll.edu/colorandmoney>.
