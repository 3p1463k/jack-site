Sankofa is a consortium of performing and teaching artists in many disciplines including dance, music, and visual and textile arts. Our programs are designed to be like an imaginative journey that promotes cultural enrichment, arts education and a greater understanding and appreciation of African culture by all. The program takes place in the Hartford Public Schools. Our school for this session is the Fred D. Wish School on the north end of Hartford. Our program runs Monday through Friday from 3:15-5:45pm.

We currently have three volunteer opportunities available:

  * Teaching artist assistant: help the teaching artist on site at the school and work directly with the children;
  * Administrative assistant: assist the office with daily tasks; must know how to use Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, etc)
  * Documentarian/Video Editor: catalogue the program’s photos and short films from various events

We have two locations:

  * Office address: 57 Woodstock St, Hartford, CT 06143
  * School Address: Fred D. Wish School, 350 Barbour St, Hartford, CT 06112

Transportation from Trinity College: see Google Maps for public transit or rent Zip Car
