For a different type of writing assignment, I sometimes ask students to compose an op-ed essay that succinctly communicates their point of view for readers of a general publication. &#8220;Op-ed&#8221; usually refers to a signed opinion essay by an outside contributor that appears &#8220;opposite the editorial page&#8221; of unsigned opinions by the publication&#8217;s staff. Trinity students and faculty have submitted op-ed essays to local news publications, such as the _The Hartford Courant_ (see <a title="guidelines" href="http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/thc-oped-guidelines,0,1707723.htmlstory" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a>, the <a title="op-ed" href="http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/otheropinion/" target="_blank">recent op-ed page</a>, and search for <a title="fresh talk" href="http://www.courant.com/search/dispatcher.front?Query=%22fresh+talk%22&btnSubmit=&target=adv_all&date=&sortby=contentrankprof" target="_blank">&#8220;Fresh Talk&#8221; op-eds by writers younger than 30 years of age</a>) and the <a title="commons" href="http://www.ctmirror.org/commons/archive" target="_blank"><em>CT Mirror</em> &#8220;Commons&#8221; section</a>.

See helpful advice from these guides to writing effective op-ed essays:

When preparing an op-ed essay for a course writing assignment, I require students to cite sources (for internal fact-checking only; remove them before submitting to a newspaper) and usually require a 1,000-word essay (to be shortened to an appropriate length before submitting to a publication).
