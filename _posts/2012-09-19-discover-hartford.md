I will pay registration fees for the **first four Trinity students or recent alumni** who persuade me that they want to ride with the <a title="bike tour" href="http://www.bikewalkct.org/discover-hartford.html" target="_blank">Discover Hartford bike tour on the morning of Saturday, September 29th, 2012</a>. It&#8217;s a fun event that features a 10-mile and 25-mile route through the city&#8217;s parks and neighborhoods (or if you&#8217;re more ambitious, a 40-mile excursion into the suburbs), but the registration fee ($30 to $45, to benefit the BikeWalkCT organization) may not fit your budget. Since I&#8217;m already planning to make a donation to the organization, and would like to encourage Trinity folk to come along for the ride, this seems like the best way to do it. Biking is a great way to learn more about Hartford, since you see much more than you do in a car, but cover greater distance than on foot. Many of my Trinity colleagues and students know that I enjoy zipping around the Hartford region on my bike and try to commute (most, but not all days) on two wheels.<figure id="attachment_624" style="width: 293px" class="wp-caption alignleft">

For the past two years I rode the 25-mile route, and this time I&#8217;ll be volunteering as a &#8220;mobile mechanic&#8221; to help riders fix flat tires or other small repairs along the way. **_Update_: **Yesterday I did the pre-ride with the team that laid out the new route, which takes us in a different direction (counter-clockwise around the city&#8217;s parks) than the old route, with several advantages. One plus: we&#8217;ll start together from Bushnell Park and ride through downtown Hartford streets while we&#8217;re still a &#8220;big pack,&#8221; with bike police escorts to block traffic, then jump onto the Riverfront Park trail as the riders begin to spread out. All of us will head north to the extensive Keney Park trails, which I had never explored until my first Discover Hartford tour two years ago. The 10-mile route (in red) and the 25-mile route (in green) ride together until we reach Classical Magnet School (corner of Woodland and Albany Ave.), where those who choose the longer ride head west to Elizabeth Park, then south to Pope Park, Trinity College, Goodwin Park, and Colt Park.

How do you persuade me that you should be one of the lucky ones to receive a free registration? Tell me why you want to go  &#8212; by speaking with me in person, or by writing a persuasive email &#8212; and confirm that you have (or can borrow) a bike and helmet. This is a friendly touring event (not a race), with rest stops, food, and bathrooms along the way. You don&#8217;t need to be an experienced biker to enjoy a 10- or 25-mile ride, but you do need to be willing to escape the &#8220;Trinity Bubble&#8221; and try something new. Contact me before the early registration deadline (which **ends on Wednesday Sept 26th at 5pm**). Come and enjoy the ride.
