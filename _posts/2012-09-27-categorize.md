When you create a WordPress post for one of my courses, you need to categorize it properly so that it appears in the correct portion of our class website. If you forget this step, then your work will not appear in the right place, and you won&#8217;t receive credit for it. When you create a new post, add a new category (spelled exactly as shown in the syllabus), and make sure that the box is checked when you publish your work.

[<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-587" src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/AddNewCat.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="346" srcset="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/AddNewCat.jpg 600w, http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/AddNewCat-300x173.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" />](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/AddNewCat.jpg)

How it works: As the instructor, I use the <a title="feedwordpress" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/feedwordpress/" target="_blank">FeedWordPress plugin</a> to subscribe to new content on my students&#8217; sites and automatically publish it under the appropriate category on the class site. In the syllabus, each web-posting exercise includes a specific category (usually one word, such as &#8220;zoning&#8221;). The FeedWordPress settings allow me to automatically publish only those student posts that include this category.
