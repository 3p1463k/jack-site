Similarly, existing studies of families choosing and participating in schools have discovered inequalities in who participates in choice systems, but at times over-emphasized parents’ interest in status-reproduction while neglecting parents’ beliefs about civic values and community. Studying two public Montessori magnet schools, Mira&#8217;s research represents a diverse cross-section of urban and suburban parents in order to examine the on-the-ground impact of _Sheff v O&#8217;Neill_ as well as broader questions of educational equity, school desegregation, and the role of parents in school choice and school change.
