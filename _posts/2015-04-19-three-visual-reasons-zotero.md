Yesterday it happened again. I was invited to give a talk about &#8220;[crafting your research-to-writing process](http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2015/04/18/writing-aera-2015/)&#8221; for graduate students at an academic conference. When I meet with groups of junior scholars in reading-intensive fields, such as history, I pose this question and ask for a show of hands: How many of you use a bibliography management tool to keep track of books and articles you&#8217;ve read, so that you can easily cite them later in your writing? Only half of the audience raised their hands. My jaw drops every time this happens. Later, when I probe further with the other half who use these software tools, several confide that they don&#8217;t fully understand how to make effective use of them in their scholarship. Why not? Probably because it&#8217;s still uncommon for scholars to openly teach, share, and learn new ways of composing our written works, despite the fact that it&#8217;s the primary way we evaluate the quality of our students and faculty. This mismatch never ceases to amaze me.

[<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2012" alt="zotero_logo_small" src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zotero_logo_small.png" width="300" height="70" />](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zotero_logo_small.png)To address this problem, I&#8217;ve learned to blend a three-minute visual demonstration on why and how to use a bibliographic tool into my broader presentation on the academic research-to-writing process. This pitch is relevant to all scholars, including senior and junior faculty, graduate students, and also undergraduates or independent scholars working on long-form writing projects. Incorporating a bibliographic management tool into your workflow may improve the quality of your scholarship, or at minimum, your sanity. While there are several applications on the market, my favorite is [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org), a [freely downloadable](https://www.zotero.org/download/) and open-source application from the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. If you&#8217;ve never heard of Zotero, think of it as &#8220;iTunes for book and articles,&#8221; an unofficial tagline that sticks with many first-time users. But it does much more. And in case you didn&#8217;t catch this part, it&#8217;s free.

In my presentation I briefly demonstrate three _basic_ ways to use Zotero, featuring the standalone version with a web browser and word processor. To give readers of this web essay a richer sense of what my presentation audiences actually see, I&#8217;ve inserted three looped GIF animations to illustrate the dynamic concepts, which are not easily captured with static images. Combined, it should take less than three minutes to read the text and view the animations, which makes this short enough to fit into my longer talks about the scholarly research and writing process. If you&#8217;re an educator at the college or graduate school level, consider designing your own three-minute demonstration to show in class. Or invite a student to show it. Or assign this online essay to your class.

**1) Save books and articles from your browser into your Zotero library.** After installing the free tool, look for the source icon (a book or article symbol) to save the item into your library, with a snapshot of the page or PDF if available. Always check the metadata and fill in any important items that the computer could not automatically save for you. Manually enter items that are not online, and type in reading notes if desired.<figure id="attachment_2016" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignright">

**2) Shift and drag items to create formatted footnotes in your word processor.** If you produce scholarship in a field that relies on footnotes, such as history, Zotero is a magical time-saver. Learn how to change citation styles below, and see more advanced steps in my tutorial.<figure id="attachment_2018" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignright">

**3) Choose your citation format and drag items to create a quick bibliography.**<figure id="attachment_2015" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignright">

Now are you convinced that you should [download the free and open-source Zotero tool](http://www.zotero.org/download)? To learn more beyond these very basic features, read their [quick start guide](https://www.zotero.org/support/quick_start_guide) or see my two longer illustrated tutorials:

  * [How to Capture and Cite Sources with Zotero](http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-zotero/)
  * [How to Sync Sources and Share Group Libraries with Zotero](http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-sync-sources-and-share-group-libraries-with-zotero/)

This book explores why online writing matters for liberal arts learning and illustrates how different faculty teach with web-based tools for authoring, annotating, peer editing, and publishing. Note that the bonus tutorials, with rich illustrations and video screencasts, appear _only_ in the Trinity College ePress edition, which readers may freely read online or download at [WebWriting.trincoll.edu](http://webwriting.trincoll.edu).

This open-access peer-reviewed volume explores questions such as: Has the digital revolution transformed how we write about the past — or not? Have new technologies changed our essential work-craft as scholars, and the ways in which we think, teach, author, and publish? Does the digital age have broader implications for individual writing processes, or for the historical profession at large? Readers may purchase a print edition or freely read online at the [University of Michigan Press](http://www.digitalculture.org/books/writing-history-in-the-digital-age/).
