For Family Weekend at Trinity this fall, all departments and programs have been encouraged to host an open house event for students and their visitors to learn more about our academic offerings. But there&#8217;s no rule against holding your &#8220;open house&#8221; in someone else&#8217;s more glamorous looking house! So instead of our regular offices in McCook, come drop in anytime between 3-5pm on Friday September 21st at Peter B&#8217;s cafe in the Trinity Library. Meet Jack Dougherty, associate professor and director of the <a title="Ed Studies" href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Educational Studies Program</a>, who will be showing photos of community-learning outreach and research work by our students, and hanging out to chat and enjoy your favorite cafe beverages. Come and stop by &#8212; even if your family isn&#8217;t visiting &#8212; because his family won&#8217;t be there either (they can&#8217;t stand this type of event). So he&#8217;ll be lonely. Unless you stop by to visit.
