Trinity senior Fionnuala Darby-Hudgens (Educational Studies major and IDP &#8217;13) was invited by her community-learning partner, the <a href="http://www.ctfairhousing.org/" target="_blank">Connecticut Fair Housing Center</a>, to provide testimony on her thesis research at a March 18th public hearing of the <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/PD/" target="_blank">Planning and Development Committee</a> of the Connecticut General Assembly. Fionnuala&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/PDdata/Tmy/2013HB-06574-R000318-Fionnuala%20Darby-%20Hudgens-TMY.PDF" target="_blank">testimony</a> explained why she supports <a href="http://www.cga.ct.gov/2013/TOB/H/2013HB-06574-R00-HB.htm" target="_blank">House Bill 6574: Creating a Task Force to Consider Impediments to Fair Housing Choice</a>. In cooperation with the Center, she analyzed municipal zoning regulations across the state&#8217;s 169 towns and coded them by type of restrictions, such as minimum lot size requirements for single-family homes, which drive up housing costs and effectively block low-to-middle income families from residing and attending public schools in several suburban communities.

Based on a publicly accessible database that Fionnuala and her colleagues constructed (available on the <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp" target="_blank">Cities Suburbs & Schools site</a>), she argued that &#8220;exclusionary zoning exists in this state, and is a direct barrier to fair housing.&#8221; Her testimony builds on a quantitative analysis of zoning policy, housing affordability, and school performance for her senior thesis in the Educational Studies Program at Trinity. Fionnuala &#8220;totally rocked the room&#8221; with her testimony, according to CT Fair Housing Center executive director Erin Kemple, and did a fantastic job of fielding questions from the legislators. One state senator recommended that she get herself appointed to the proposed Task Force. Trinity College has supported Fionnuala&#8217;s investigation with <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/UrbanGlobal/CUGS/students/Research/Pages/Levy.aspx" target="_blank">Levy Research Grant for Urban Studies</a> and aÂ <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/cli-research/" target="_blank">Community Learning Research Fellowship</a>.
