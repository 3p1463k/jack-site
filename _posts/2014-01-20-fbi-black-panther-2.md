Four years ago on a research trip to the National Archives II in College Park, Maryland, I stumbled across a finding aid reference to the Black Panther Party of Hartford case files compiled by the New Haven field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (In case you&#8217;re wondering, this is listed as case 157-NH-1079, Boxes 31-32, Entry P-37, Record Group 65. While neither the finding aid and the case files are online, see the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/065.html" target="_blank">general description of RG 65: FBI</a> on NARA.gov.) Since these files are restricted, the archive staff guided me through the process of submitting a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for the documents to be reviewed for public release. Also, they cautioned that the process would take a long time (which turned out to be even longer than usual because my request was misplaced for some time).

Last week the National Archives <a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/NARA-Hartford-BlackPanthers-2014-01-08.pdf" target="_blank">sent a letter</a> to inform me that they screened the FBI case file and have released 1,582 pages, though withheld others under certain exemptions. The letter states that &#8220;We can make this file available to you or your representative&#8221; (or any member of the public, I presume) in the College Park research room with 72 hours notice, or I can pay them 80 cents per page ($1,265) to digitally scan the contents onto a disk for me. Since I don&#8217;t have a spare grand sitting around, this will have to wait until my next trip to the DC area, which probably won&#8217;t happen until late May 2014. I&#8217;m sharing this news in case other historically-minded folks wish to venture to DC before I return. When I last visited NARA, they had a very generous policy that allowed researchers to <a href="http://www.archives.gov/dc-metro/college-park/researcher-info.html" target="_blank">make their own photos/scans</a> of unclassified public documents. While I don&#8217;t yet know the quality of the contents of this FBI case file, an ideal outcome would be to return a digital copy of this history back to Hartford.

Next month the <a href="http://center.hplct.org/" target="_blank">Center for Contemporary Culture at Hartford Public Library</a> will host an event, &#8220;A Conversation with Butch Lewis: The Black Panther Party in Connecticut,&#8221; from 1-3pm on Sunday, February 23rd, 2014. The announcement reads:
