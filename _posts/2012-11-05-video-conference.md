When setting up a video conference with one individual (such as interviewing a guest author in class, or advising a student abroad), I usually rely on a free Skype account because it&#8217;s a familiar and easy-to-use tool for others. But if the objective is to organize a group video conference with several participants (and the option to broadcast it publicly on the web), then the best freely-accessible tool is Google+. Here&#8217;s a typical invitation that I send out to up to 9 video conference participants:

> Invitation: If you plan to join us on the web, register for a <a href="https://plus.google.com/" target="_blank">free Google+ account</a>, and click on my <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/116038132633700368848/posts" target="_blank">Google+ profile</a> to add me to your circles (and I&#8217;ll do the same). Then just before the event, log onto your Google+ page and look for an invitation from me to join our “hangout” video conference session. (Note: If I wish to publicly broadcast our conference, my invitation also requests permission to record it.)

Instructions for the video conference organizer: On your <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/" target="_blank">Google+ page</a>, click &#8220;Start a hangout&#8221; (upper-right corner) and invite up to 9 other active participants in the video chat, which they will join via their Google+ pages.

Invite friends to be active participants, name the hangout, and if broadcasting publicly, enable it to be &#8220;On Air.&#8221;

Start the video hangout, invite participants to join and check their sound & camera feeds. If this is a private conference among the participants, proceed with the discussion.

If the session is to be broadcast publicly, make sure that all agree to be recorded. To simultaneously broadcast for non-participating viewers, click the &#8220;Embed&#8221; button to copy and paste the code of the upcoming video feed to your site (such as a WordPress post or page, using the HTML editor). The embed code will not appear until your hangout has begun, so you cannot do this step ahead of time (and it may require a bit of juggling.)

When all of the conference participants are ready, click the &#8220;Start Broadcast&#8221; button, wait for the countdown (about five seconds), then officially begin your live, recorded conversation.

Non-participating viewers may will see a live YouTube video feed of the session on the website where you have embedded the code above. After your hangout session ends, the feed will automatically convert into a YouTube recording for future viewers. However, my WordPress site displayed a small YouTube screen that viewers could not enlarge. So I went to my YouTube account, found the URL for the video recording (which finished processing a few minutes after our live session ended), and pasted it into the WordPress page, in place of the embed code, to give viewers more control over the recorded session.

Two examples of Google+ public broadcasts: a <a title="chat" href="http://ontheline.trincoll.edu/2012/06/video-chat/" target="_blank">digital humanities video chat</a> and a <a title="conference" href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2012/10/02/teaching/" target="_blank">video conference with recent alumni and current students</a>.
