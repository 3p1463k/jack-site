Trinity&#8217;s Individualized Degree Program for adult undergraduate students invited me and Claudia Malaga (IDP Class of 2015) to present to their Open House guests about collaborative knowledge creation in the liberal arts. Here&#8217;s a [direct link to our slides](http://bit.ly/Dougherty-2016-02-15), which also are embedded below.
