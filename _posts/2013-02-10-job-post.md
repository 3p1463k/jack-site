As one of the faculty members on the search committee, I&#8217;m reaching out to prospective candidates through my own networks, such as <a href="http://thatcamp.org" target="_blank">THATCamp</a>, <a href="http://www.nitle.org/" target="_blank">NITLE</a>, <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/" target="_blank">ProfHacker</a>, and relationships developed through digital scholarship projects such as _<a href="http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu" target="_blank">Writing History in the Digital Age</a>_ and _<a href="http://ontheline.trincoll.edu" target="_blank">On The Line</a>._ Furthermore, as co-chair of Trinity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/LITC/its/ITEC/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Information Technology in Education Committee (ITEC)</a>, I can attest that we have a good working relationship between IT professionals and faculty, who regularly collaborate to offer workshops, course development grants, and a new discussion group to experience and evaluate digital courses and their implications for liberal arts learning. Our Director of ITS, Sue Aber, created this position to build on our strengths and expand for the future.

Trinity is one of the few nationally-recognized liberal arts colleges located in a capital city, and <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/UrbanGlobal/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">urban and global</a> initiatives are one way that we define our institutional mission. As a small, residential liberal arts college, with a <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Admissions/AboutTrinity/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">student/faculty ratio of about 10:1</a>, we cultivate rich learning opportunities for undergraduates. This position has the potential to develop working relationships with other campuses, including nearby Wesleyan University and Connecticut College (members of our CTW library consortium), and institutions in the Five College Consortium (Amherst/Northampton, MA is 45 minutes to the north) and New Haven, CT (45 minutes to the south). Hartford is located halfway between Boston and New York City (each 2 hours away), and is known to some as the Mason-Dixon line of the Red Sox vs. Yankees baseball rivalry.
