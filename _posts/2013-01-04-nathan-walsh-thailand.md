This letter and photo arrived from recent Ed Studies graduate Nathan Walsh, who is teaching in Thailand, and asked me to post online to assist with his recruitment drive. I recall working with him in the introductory Ed 200 course during his first year,  and also on his senior thesis during his last semester at Trinity, so it&#8217;s wonderful to learn how far he has extended his liberal arts education by teaching abroad this year. (As an extra bonus, it&#8217;s great to see him on a bike!). Thanks for keeping in touch, Nathan, and I encourage other alumni to reach out and do the same. &#8211; Jack<figure id="attachment_1121" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

  After graduating from Trinity in 2012, I moved abroad to Thailand to teach English. Now, I am teaching English to students in grades 7, 11 and 12 at Khelang Nakorn, a public school in northern Thailand. While challenging, it has been overwhelmingly positive. I would recommend the experience if you are considering working abroad. Teaching abroad provides an amazing opportunity to travel and experience new cultures while simultaneously making a significant difference in a local community. The experience builds upon many skills learned at Trinity, encourages personal and intellectual growth, and strengthens leadership skills. The Khelang Nakorn School is currently recruiting teachers to work here for the 2013-2014 academic year.

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  Khelang Nakorn is a public secondary school serving approximately 1,900 students in grades 7-12 located in Lampang, Thailand. A small city in the north of Thailand, Lampang provides an opportunity to experience traditional Thai life that has not been altered by the over-commercialization common of larger cities. As a teacher at Khelang Nakorn, you will be joining a large and well-funded foreign language department. You will be teaching approximately 20 hours a week, with an additional 20 hours reserved for planning or one-on-one work with students. Housing and visa expenses are covered by the school. The academic year runs from June until March and teachers will be asked to sign a 10-month contract with the school.

<p style="padding-left: 30px">
  As a foreign language teacher at Khelang Nakorn, you may be asked to:<br /> ·      Plan lessons and create a basic curriculum in conjunction with other English teachers<br /> ·      Build relationships with fellow teachers and students<br /> ·      Show a willingness to learn Thai language and customs (you are not expected to have any previous Thai language skills)<br /> ·      Help prepare and run English language camps for students
