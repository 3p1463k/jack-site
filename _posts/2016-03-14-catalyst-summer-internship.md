I&#8217;m spreading the news about the Catalyst funding program, which offers $3,500 grants to support Trinity students in unpaid or low-paid summer internships. At present, the key information is buried so deeply inside the password-protected [CareerLink](https://trincoll-csm.symplicity.com) database at the Career Development Center, which makes it hard to find. (Try a Google search for &#8220;Trinity College Catalyst Summer Internship&#8221; and you&#8217;ll find [this Tripod story](https://commons.trincoll.edu/tripod/2016/03/08/catalyst-summer-internship-helps-unpaid-interns/), but as of today, nothing on the Center&#8217;s own website.)

Even when you access CareerLink, it&#8217;s not easy to find. Typing &#8220;Catalyst&#8221; in the search box did not work for me. I had to go to Employers > Trinity College > Available Positions to find the info that I&#8217;ve reposted below.

The basics: Eligibility is limited to Trinity 1st, 2nd, and 3rd-year students with a GPA of 3.0 or above. Applications accepted until April 8th, 2016. Preference is given to students who have attended CDC workshops or had prior appointments with their staff. See more details in the [Student Learning Agreement PDF](http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/catalyst-learning-agreement-2016.pdf).

From the CareerLink web page (with links to PDFs I downloaded):
