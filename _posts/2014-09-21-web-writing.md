This open-access scholarly book is forthcoming from the <a href="http://www.press.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan Press at Michigan Publishing</a>, which will make the text available in paper (for sale) and online (for free). The volume explores **why** online writing matters for liberal arts education and illustrates **how** students and faculty engage in this work, with digital examples and tutorials. Based on essays from over twenty contributors, the volume argues for the thoughtful integration of web-based authoring, annotating, editing, and publishing tools into what the liberal arts do best: teaching writing and clearer thinking across the curriculum.

An open peer review of the draft manuscript took place in fall 2013, <a href="http://webwriting.trincoll.edu/2013/10/1000-plus/" target="_blank">when over 1,000 comments were posted</a> by 70 readers, including four expert reviewers commissioned by the publisher. The book began with an open call for essays in spring 2013, which generated an online discussion on over sixty ideas. Financial support for this book has been generously provided by the <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/teaching/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Center for Teaching and Learning at Trinity College</a>, and also by the <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/TIIS/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Trinity Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies</a>, in Hartford, Connecticut.
