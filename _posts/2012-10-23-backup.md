Before you launch a major WordPress publishing project, be sure to figure out an automatic routine for creating backups of the relevant files, check their integrity, and learn how to reinstall them before a crisis occurs. (See <a title="codex" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups" target="_blank">WordPress Codex on backups</a>.) Reinstalling WordPress can be complex and may require the assistance of a trained system administrator. But creating a backup routine is relatively straightforward.

Personally, I use the <a title="backup" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/backwpup/" target="_blank">BackWPup plugin</a> to run scheduled backups of my WordPress **database** and **content** files (both are essential!) on a daily basis, and **themes/plugins** on a weekly basis, and upload them into my Dropbox account. This plugin has other upload features, and some WordPress users prefer other plugins, so explore your options.

My largest WordPress/CommentPress publishing project, <a title="whda" href="http://writinghistory.trincoll.edu" target="_blank"><em>Writing History in the Digital Age</em></a>, included so much content that I needed to split the automatic backup into separate jobs, as shown below.

More detailed screenshots of the two most important daily backup jobs &#8212; **DB** (the database of all posts, pages, comments, etc.) and **content** (the file backup of WordPress root files, media uploads, etc.) &#8212; are shown below:

I run a backup of WordPress themes/plugins on a weekly basis, because those do not change as often as the items above.
