Fionnuala Darby-Hudgens (IDP &#8217;13) and I led a presentation and discussion on &#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e_3neAfEXuhtbPpJhQJ-JE5DDrST6eOmIu-slOffgHo/edit#slide=id.gb94c216_0_28" target="_blank">Creating Knowledge Collaboratively in the Liberal Arts</a>&#8221; for the Individualized Degree Program adult-student orientation today at Trinity College. My goal was to raise broader philosophical debates over the meaning of learning in higher education (particularly in today&#8217;s context of MOOCs and the &#8220;Googlization of everything&#8221;), and the opportunities that small liberal arts colleges can offer for more engaged, collaborative learning, with specific examples available at Trinity. The discussion offered me an opportunity to listen how adult students, both newcomers and veterans, reflect on their own learning experiences in higher education, and what they find to be overwhelming, yet valuable.
