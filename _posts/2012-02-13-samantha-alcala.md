Samantha Alcala, a dual major in Educational Studies and Psychology from the Class of 2011, will return to Trinity to share her experiences and offer personal advice about <a href="http://www.citizenschools.org/newyork/" target="_blank">Citizen Schools New York</a>. This educational non-profit organization partners with NYC public middle schools in low income communities to extend the learning day to 6pm. Teaching Fellows (TFs) are essential to the success of the Citizen Schools’ program. The National Teaching Fellowship is a unique, competitive, two-year professional and leadership development program that offers a diverse range of experiences to people of varied backgrounds who have high potential as educators and leaders. Each TF leads a group of approximately 12-18 students, supporting their academic achievement through communication with families, academic support, and by facilitating hands-on, learning activities led by community volunteers. The Citizen Schools’ program offers TFs the opportunity to engage students in a diverse range of educational experiences and provides leadership development support – with the ultimate goal of preparing students for high school success, and enhanced college and career access.

Samantha will hold an information session at Trinity&#8217;s Career Services office on Wednesday February 22nd, 2012 at 4:30pm. Students who wish to schedule an individual meeting time on Feb 22-23rd are encouraged to email her at <SamanthaAlcala@citizenschools.org>.
