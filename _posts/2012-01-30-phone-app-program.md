The after school program serves 9-12th grade students from local schools such as the Greater Hartford Academy of Math and Science (GHAMAS) and, starting this semester, HMTCA students. During the program, students learn [App Inventor](http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/), an online tool that allows non-programmers to create applications for the Android phone. The students also learn basic Computer Science principles while having fun and creating cool apps for their phones. You can learn more by clicking the link above and/or by going to the following site:  <http://sites.google.com/site/aiprogramsummer2011/>

This is a great opportunity, especially for those who are interested in teaching and/or working with local high school students.

  * You **do not** need to have any prior Computer Science experience.
  * You **do not** need to have any prior experience with App Inventor.
  * You will have the opportunity to **earn 0.25 credit** for program training but you can also choose to volunteer.
  * **Priority will be given to first years and sophomores**.

Are you: Interested in this opportunity? Willing to learn? Willing to commit to working with a small group of students for 2-3 days a week for 6-9 weeks? If you answered &#8216;Yes&#8217; to any or all of these questions, then **please contact Pauline Lake &#8217;13 by** **February 6th, 2012** **via email** **<pauline.lakealmeida@trincoll.edu>**
