In 2015, North Hartford became one of only 22 promise zones to be named in the entire country. As we begin our second year with the <a href="http://www.hartford.gov/mayors-office/north-hartford-promise-zone"><span class="s2">North Hartford Promise Zone</span></a> designation we would like to share information regarding the exciting North Hartford Promise Zone AmeriCorps VISTA service opportunities that are available.  Currently, the <a href="http://www.hartford.gov/mayors-office/north-hartford-promise-zone"><span class="s2">North Hartford Promise Zone</span></a> is seeking candidates who are interested in serving as North Hartford Promise Zone <a href="https://my.americorps.gov/mp/login.do"><span class="s2">AmeriCorps VISTA</span></a> members. </span>
