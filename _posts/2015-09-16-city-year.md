Today I learned more about [City Year](http://www.cityyear.org/), an urban school partnership and mentoring program, by meeting Tiesha Nieves, the organization&#8217;s Northeast regional recruiter, during her visit to Trinity College. We talked about former Trinity students who participated in City Year ([such as Jessica Wanger &#8217;07](http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2012/03/28/alumni-event/#comment-949)), and how the program has shifted over time to place its volunteers inside urban schools to collaborate with teachers and tutor youth individually or in small groups. As an AmeriCorps program, City Year participants also receive a living stipend ($564 bi-weekly), health insurance, and a $5,730 education award at the conclusion of their service to repay student loans or pursue more schooling. To learn more, reach out to Tiesha [via email](mailto:Tnieves@cityyear.org) or tweet[ @TNieves_CY](https://twitter.com/tnieves_cy).
