&#8211; How to login to our Trinity Commons site above, navigate the Dashboard &#8220;back end,&#8221; and update your personal profile

&#8211; How to create a **sample post**, save a draft, and preview it in a new tab

&#8211; <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2012/09/27/screenshot/" target="_blank">How to capture a screenshot</a>, and <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2012/10/17/add-links-images/" target="_blank">how to add links, images, videos</a>, and always **credit sources of visuals created by others** (or else you&#8217;re stealing credit for their work)

&#8211; How to create a **real post**, categorize it (category = student-reflections), and submit it for publication.
  
_Note:_ For this CLI Research site, Fellows have &#8220;contributor&#8221; status with extra privileges, which allows you to upload images, but still requires a site editor to approve your submission before it it will be published on the web. If you submit a post, email TAMichael Oleskewicz, who will check it and refer to Professor Clark or Dougherty for approval to be published to the web. By contrast, on your personal Trinity Commons WordPress site, you have full authoring privileges.

&#8211; Discussion: What should (or should not) be published on the web about your project? How will you make these decisions with your faculty advisor and/or community partner?
