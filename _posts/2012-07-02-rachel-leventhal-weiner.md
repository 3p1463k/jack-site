In the fall semester, she will teach our introductory _Educ 200: Analyzing Schools_ course (with school placement support from me) and assist Professor Andrea Dyrness with advising independent student projects in the _Educ 400: Senior Research Seminar_. During Spring 2013, she will redesign and teach her own course, Educ 315: _Higher Education in America_, which will count as a research project course for Educational Studies majors.

As a sociologist of education, Rachel explores how children&#8217;s aspirations toward higher education vary across families and communities. She is completing her doctoral dissertation on the spatial stratification of student outcomes in rural, urban, and suburban contexts, and will earn her Ph.D. from the Department of Sociology at the University of Connecticut. Her training includes both quantitative and qualitative methods. She received her bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics at Rutgers University, and a master&#8217;s degree in higher & post-secondary education at Teachers College, Columbia University, and previously served as a house advisor at Vassar College. During graduate school at UConn, Rachel taught her own writing-intensive introductory sociology courses as well as an upper-level sociology of education class.

Professor Leventhal-Weiner views her teaching &#8220;to be a form of activism&#8221; and builds critical thinking and writing exercises into her courses &#8220;to expose students to new ideas in their social world, to their role in the social hierarchy, and to ways of improving social life for themselves and others.&#8221; She is enthusiastic about joining the Trinity faculty and incorporating community-learning experiences with Hartford in her courses.
