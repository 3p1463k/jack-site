Want your computer to handle the details of citing sources in the proper format? Share bibliographic references, notes, and attachments with research partners? And also get a cool sticker to accessorize your laptop? Thanks to <a href="http://www.zotero.org" target="_blank">Zotero</a>, the free and open-source research and citation manager tool developed by <a href="http://chnm.gmu.edu" target="_blank">CHNM</a>, you can have it all (including one of the hundred stickers they gave me to help spread the word).

To start the new semester, I revamped two of my online tutorials for students and colleagues. For beginners, start withÂ <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/how-to/zotero-basic/" target="_blank">How to capture, manage, and cite sources with Zotero 4</a>, which now includes a <a href="http://youtu.be/HlvDyIFeMrE" target="_blank">video screencast</a> to illustrate how I make it work on my machine (and my first time using the Camtasia 2 video screencast tool.) I designed the tutorial for students in my seminars this fall (<a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/colorandmoney" target="_blank">Color & Money</a>; <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp" target="_blank">Cities Suburbs & Schools</a>), who need to complete a basic writing exercise to demonstrate proficiency in citing scholarly sources. The experiment is that I recommended (but did not require) students to use Zotero to complete this assignment, and also described it in class (but referred them to this online tutorial, rather than teaching it during class time). How many will successfully complete the assignment &#8212; with Zotero, or another citation tool, or manually &#8212; and will anyone be motivated by the bonus sticker incentive? Let&#8217;s find out.

If you already know the basics, then jump into the deeper end of the pool and explore <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/how-to/zotero-sync-share/" target="_blank">how to sync Zotero sources and share group libraries</a>, which demonstrates the power of collaborative research. Feedback is welcome on both tutorials and others.
