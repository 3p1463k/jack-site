The Educational Studies Program invites you to drop in and ask questions during any of the senior research presentations on Friday, December 14th, 2012 in McCook 205. Presentations are between ten to fifteen minutes, followed by Q&A with the guest evaluator and the audience. It&#8217;s a great way to learn about student-designed research projects, and for younger undergraduates to start thinking about their own studies.
