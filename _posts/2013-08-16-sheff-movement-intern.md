As an intern with the <a href="http://sheffmovement.org" target="_blank">Sheff Movement</a>, you will support the ongoing effort to create quality, integrated education in Hartford as part of the ongoing implementation of the 1996 Sheff v. O’Neill case, which has helped tens of thousands of Hartford and suburban children attend quality, integrated schools together.   The Sheff Movement coalition is separate from the legal case – it is a community based coalition of stakeholders, parents, and supporters of school integration who want to see the two way voluntary regional integration plan expanded and improved.  In an internship, you will learn more about the current state of the Sheff settlement, progress that has been made in Hartford, and obstacles that remain to realizing the goal of fully integrated schools. You will also have the opportunity to meet key players in education policy and practice in Connecticut, such as members of the legal team for the Sheff case, city and suburban school board members, school principals, community leaders, and Elizabeth Horton Sheff herself.

Interns should be familiar with Sheff desegregation remedies (see our <a href="http://www.sheffmovement.org/" target="_blank">website</a>).  Much of the work you will complete can be done on campus and on your own schedule, so it is a very flexible internship option, but one that requires excellent time-management, independence, and self-discipline. The internship is task-based, with several practical and engaging short-term assignments. Some of the specific projects you may be asked to complete include the following (but not all of these would happen during one internship):

  * Collecting and summarizing data on Sheff schools.
  * Reaching out to parents to engage them in desegregation strategies.
  * Developing materials (resource guides, charts, flyers) to promote magnet and Open Choice schools.
  * Writing profiles of magnet schools, or interviews with parents and teachers
  * Managing databases of key contacts in the legislature, parent groups, schools, and the media.
  * Attending monthly Sheff Movement meetings with parents and education administrators.
  * Assisting in organizing events, or mobilizing turnout for legislative hearings
  * Attend PTO meetings
  * Visiting school choice “satellite offices” around the city

We are looking for an intern with excellent organizational and writing skills, good people skills, and ability to work with our database system.  Access to a car is not required but is a plus, since it will enable you to get to meetings, magnet schools, and other venues. To apply, contact Phil Tegeler at <ptegeler@prrac.org>.
