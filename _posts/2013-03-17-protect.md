Some of my students who operate their own WordPress site on the Trinity Banter platform have asked for advice about protecting themselves from spam comments. There&#8217;s a few settings you should check in your WordPress dashboard. First, look at Dashboard > Settings > Discussion and decide whether or not you wish to allow people to post comments, if they need to be registered, and if comments need to be moderated. Here&#8217;s what my typical settings look like, but you may wish yours to be different:

Second, Trinity IT staff installed the Akismet spam-blocking plugin for all sites on the Banter network, so go to Dashboard > Plugins > Askismet Configuration to make sure it&#8217;s working properly. My typical settings appear as pictured below:

<a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2013/03/17/protect/akismetsettings/" rel="attachment wp-att-1244"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1244" alt="" src="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/files/2013/03/AkismetSettings-640x279.png" width="640" height="279" /></a>

Third, you can manually run Akismet to check your existing comments for spam, which is faster than deleting them individually. Go to Dashboard > Comments > Check for spam.

If you continue to have problems with WordPress spam on your Trinity Banter site, contact the HelpDesk@trincoll.edu and/or speak with your instructional technologist.
