Are you interested in working with me as a Teaching Assistant for Educ 200: Analyzing Schools on TR 9:25am in Fall 2012?

I am looking to hire 1 or 2 teaching assistants for this course. TAs help plan the course, organize school orientation sessions, facilitate discussion groups, add comments on student papers, and occasionally deliver presentations to the class. Previous TAs have described it as a fabulous experience that has helped them explore new roles and ideas about their future careers. TAs have the option of doing the work for one academic credit OR for cash (around $8-9/hour). See my <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/ScheduleGrid.aspx" target="_blank">recent Educ 200 syllabus</a>.

If you&#8217;re interested, please [email me](mailto:jack.dougherty@trincoll.edu) by **Monday April 9th, 2012** with the following information:

  * Include your name, class year, and the best phone number(s) to reach you
  * Why would you be a good match for the Ed 200 TA position?
  * What is one idea you have for improving the course or community learning experience?
  * Do you prefer to work for cash or academic credit?

I may ask some applicants to interview for the position, and will inform everyone after a decision has been made. Â &#8212; Jack Dougherty, Educational Studies Program
