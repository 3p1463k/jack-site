With these short tutorials, our goal is to introduce just the right amount of information — not too much, not too little — that build up skills and encourage participants to take the next step forward. This workshop is designed for** new users** (who are exploring these tools for the first time)** and experienced users** (who are looking for better ways to introduce newcomers to these tools).

Some of the ten-minute tutorials we&#8217;ll offer are:

  * How to collaboratively write and edit a <a title="GDoc" href="https://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2494822&ctx=cb&src=cb&cbid=1wh48ffdlb8wd" target="_blank">shared Google Document</a>
  * [How to create, organize, and add content to your WordPress site](http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/2012/10/22/create-wordpress/)
  * How to peek inside a web page and learn how the code works with <a title="firebug" href="http://getfirebug.com/" target="_blank">FireBug</a>
  * How to create thematic maps with Google Fusion Tables  http://commons.trincoll.edu/cssp/how-to/map-google-fusion-tables/
  * How to place past & present photos on a map with <a title="HistoryPin" href="http://www.historypin.com/" target="_blank">HistoryPin</a>
  * See <a title="how-to" href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/how-to/" target="_blank">additional how-to tutorials and digital tools</a>

When attending my first digital humanities workshop two years ago, I felt overwhelmed by all of the tools that other people were using. While everyone kindly shared advice, the initial learning curve was steep. I needed some friendly hands-on tutorials to understand some basics before feeling comfortable exploring further on my own. Now, with more experience, I’ve begun teaching basics of digital tools in undergraduate classes (as first steps toward semester-long projects) and faculty workshops (to enhance their teaching and scholarship). This session expands on a <a title="THATCamp" href="http://ncph2012.thatcamp.org/04/10/ten-minute-tutorials/" target="_blank">similar one that I offered at THATCamp NCPH in April 2012</a>, where several participants reported that they learned a great deal from this format.
