At a time when higher education is challenged to define itself amid the growth of MOOCs and the Google-ization of knowledge, what&#8217;s the unique value of learning offered by liberal arts colleges? Trinity College student Rachael DiPietro and I addressed this question in todays&#8217; brief presentation, &#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1e_3neAfEXuhtbPpJhQJ-JE5DDrST6eOmIu-slOffgHo/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Creating Knowledge Collaboratively in the Liberal Arts</a>,&#8221; for an orientation session of adult students in the Individualized Degree Program (IDP) at Trinity College. Rachael is entering her second year as an IDP student at Trinity, and worked closely this summer with Professor Abigail Williamson on researching perspectives on the DREAM Act and higher education access for undocumented citizens. Our presentation sparked a thoughtful discussion where Rachael and incoming IDP students traded pragmatic suggestions on how to become fully engaged with liberal arts learning opportunities at Trinity.
