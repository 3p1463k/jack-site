We are looking for dedicated, and compassionate Trinity students who can commit to a few hours per week, for the entire semester, to work with K-4<sup>th</sup> grade or middle school children on site in Hartford schools. It is a very rewarding experience, and you would be paid $10 per hour for your time. You can choose from:

  * Power Lunch: reading one-on-one with a student
  * Readers As Leaders: Assisting with program facilitation
  * Extended Day After-school program, &#8211; one-on-one tutoring and assisting with the extended day programs.
  * Classroom assistance, with the potential of working with small groups.

Background: With the help of Trinity alumna Tomoyo Wakamatsu (1993) we have obtained a Henkel Corporation grant to fund a Trinity College/Hartford Public School outreach program. Please contact Professor John Mertens (<john.mertens@trincoll.edu>) to learn more. (Posted January 2012)
