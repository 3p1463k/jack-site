I have added extended office hours for pre-registration advising during the first half of April. Ed Studies majors must meet with me in person to review their plans and release their holds (except graduating seniors, and students currently abroad, who may email or schedule a Skype session).

Book a 20-minute appointment via Google Calendar at <a href="http://bit.ly/jackofficehours" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/jackofficehours<br /> </a>or email me 2-3 possible days/times to meet. Slots are currently available:

  * Tues 4/3 12-5pm
  * Wed 4/4 12-4pm
  * Thu 4/5 12-4pm
  * Fri 4/6 9-11am, 12-3pm
  * Mon 4/9 9am-3:30pm
  * Tue 4/10 12-4pm
  * Wed 4/11 9-4pm
  * Thu 4/12 9am-12, 1:30-4pm
  * Fri 4/13 9am-1:30pm

**During Registration Week (April 16th-21st), I will be away to participate in two academic conferences: the <a href="http://www.nitle.org/events/125/presentations.php#S3C" target="_blank">National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education symposium</a> and the <a href="http://annualmeeting.oah.org/" target="_blank">Organization of American Historians-National Council on Public History meeting</a> for a session (with Candace Simpson &#8217;12) on &#8220;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xL_GczSIZTDSp237iWRMYddl31Cda_XFMPTGZJJjcVM/edit" target="_blank">Whose Civil Rights Stories on the Web?</a>&#8220;
