During my past decade at Trinity, several highly-motivated adult students have enrolled in my undergraduate classes through the IDP program, which raised the bar on the quality of intellectual discussion and academic work for all. This summer they produced a short video to help spread the word and explain IDP as an affordable entryway to Trinity. (Oddly, everyone else in the video manages to speak more slowly and calmly than me. . .)
