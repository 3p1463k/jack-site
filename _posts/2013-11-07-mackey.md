Visiting Assistant Professor of Educational Studies Megan Mackey will teach _Educ 218: Special Education_ at Trinity on Mondays 1:15-3:55pm in Spring 2014. Dr. Mackey joins us from the University of Hartford, where she is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Education. Her scholarship and teaching focus on the inclusion of students with disabilities in middle school classrooms; the effects of number-sense instruction among kindergarten students; video self-monitoring to improve behavior among twins with autism; and the effectiveness of afterschool programming at Billings Forge Community Works in Hartford.

_Course description: Educ 218: Special Education — How are children labeled (or mislabeled) as having learning and developmental disabilities, autism, or attention deficit disorder? How have definitions and diagnoses of learning disorders changed over time? How does the law seek to ensure the accommodation of the needs of individuals with learning disabilities? Students will critically analyze current research on disorders, examine special education case law and advocacy, and explore issues through community learning placements and interviews with teachers and parents._
  
 _Prerequisite: C- or better in Educ 200: Analyzing Schools or Psyc 295: Child Development or permission of instructor._

For any questions, contact Professor Jack Dougherty, who directs the Educational Studies Program.
