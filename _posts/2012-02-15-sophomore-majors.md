    Sophomores will be blocked from course pre-registration in April unless they declare their majors in March, according to a new rule at Trinity College. If you&#8217;re interested in learning more about the interdisciplinary Educational Studies Program, see our &#8220;<a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Pages/Declare.aspx" target="_blank">How to Declare a Major</a>&#8221; page.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Download the Ed Studies <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Documents/declare%20major%202011.pdf" target="_blank">major declaration worksheet</a> to understand our requirements: 5 core courses, 4 in a thematic concentration, and 3 additional electives, for a total of 12.

    Explore how to fulfill requirements with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtmGKybdRLlZdGR0eFdtVE5mVlN0d2QyVkpVMmU3bFE&hl=en_US#gid=0" target="_blank">list of Ed Studies and cross-listed courses</a>. Since students do not know exactly which courses will be offered more than a year in advance, identify those that interest you and mark the semester as &#8220;TBA&#8221; if needed.

    <a href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/advising/">Schedule a meeting with Professor Jack Dougherty</a>, who currently directs the Ed Studies Program, to review your plans and learn more about your options, including dual majors and study-away semesters.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Draft your proposal in a word-processing document, following the format of the samples on the second page of the <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/MajorsAndMinors/educational/Documents/declare%20major%202011.pdf" target="_blank">worksheet</a> above. When the Director approves your proposal, a printed copy will be attached to your major declaration form to submit to the Registrar, and a digital copy will be kept by you and the Director to update for future advising meetings as new course schedules become available.
