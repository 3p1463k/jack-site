  <span class="s1"><a href="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WebWritingCoverSmall.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2002"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2002" src="http://localhost/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WebWritingCoverSmall.jpg" alt="WebWritingCoverSmall" width="127" height="190" /></a>Do you or your students share their writing, or comment on other students&#8217; drafts, with Google Documents? Or do you or your students publish your ideas on a WordPress platform? If you&#8217;re looking for illustrated tutorials on key steps in the process, see these newly-updated chapters in the back of our open-access <a href="http://webwriting.trincoll.edu">Web Writing</a> book, published by University of Michigan Press in 2015, and freely available (with occasional updates, like this one) at <a href="http://webwriting.trincoll.edu">http://webwriting.trincoll.edu</a></span>
</p>

  We designed these tutorials for college-level educators to share with their students. To learn how to share and peer edit with Google Docs, see: <span class="s2"><a href="http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-google-docs">http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-google-docs</a></span>
</p>

  To learn how to present your writing and visuals on WordPress, see:  <span class="s2"><a href="http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-publish-on-wordpress/">http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-publish-on-wordpress/</a></span>
</p>

  <span class="s1">Now you can point students to specific sections by adding a hashtag for the header keyword to the end of the web address. For example, to show my students how to prepare their Google Docs for a peer editing exercise, I point them to the &#8220;Advanced&#8221; Share section of that tutorial by appending the #advanced hashtag, like this: </span><span class="s2"><a href="http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-google-docs/#advanced">http://epress.trincoll.edu/webwriting/chapter/how-to-google-docs/#advanced</a></span>
