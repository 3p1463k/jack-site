Listen to the story of Curtis Acosta, a high school educator from Tucson, who will speak on &#8220;Banned Histories: Mexican-American Studies and the Struggle for Educational Justice in Arizona&#8221; on **Tuesday, October 2nd, 2012 from 12:15-1:30pm** (Common Hour) at Rittenberg Lounge, Mather Student Center, Trinity College. According to the lecture announcement: &#8220;In January 2012, the governing board of the Tucson Unified School District voted to terminate the popular and enormously successful Mexican American Studies program, under pressure from the Arizona State Superintendent of Instruction. Two weeks earlier a judge had found it in violation of a new Arizona state law prohibiting classes designed for particular ethnic groups. Curtis Acosta, an educator from Tucson, will speak about the development of the Mexican-American Studies curriculum, its success with students, how and why it was found illegal, and the ongoing struggle for Mexican-American rights in Arizona.&#8221; Read more <a title="rethinking schools" href="http://rethinkingschoolsblog.wordpress.com/2011/12/29/repeat-after-me-the-united-states-is-not-an-imperialist-country-oh-and-dont-get-emotional-about-war-2/" target="_blank">about the controversy from <em>Rethinking Schools</em></a>, and learn more about Curtis Acosta from the <a title="williamette" href="http://www.willamette.edu/scene/editions/2012/winter/features/26/index.html" target="_blank">Williamette University <em>Scene</em> magazine</a>.
