Baldridge, a Ph.D. candidate in Sociology and Education from Teachers College at Columbia University, will visit Trinity College on Wednesday, February 29th, 2012 to speak about her research and teaching. At 12 noon she will deliver a research presentation on her dissertation, titled &#8220;(Re)Imagining Black Youth: The Political, Social, and Academic Impact of &#8216;Youth Work&#8217; in Community Based Educational Spaces,&#8221; in Terrace Room C, Mather Student Center, with a light lunch available &#8212; first come, first served. At 4pm, Ms. Baldridge will lead a teaching discussion, including ideas for a course she would propose to offer, in McCook 305. Both events are open to the public.

Bianca J. Baldridge was nominated by the Educational Studies Program and Sociology Department and is a finalist for the 2012-13 <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/dean/positions/Pages/Ann.aspx" target="_blank">Ann Plato Diversity Fellowship</a> at Trinity College. A native of South Central Los Angeles, she received her bachelor&#8217;s degree in American Studies with a minor in African American Studies from the University of California at Berkeley, where she also designed and instructed two student-initiated courses and conducted community-based research as a McNair Scholar.

At Columbia University, her dissertation research explores the experiences of youth workers (i.e., adults who teach, guide, and mentor youth) within out-of-school time community based educational spaces. Through a critical ethnographic research design at an urban community-based after school program, her dissertation examines the particular ways that youth are “framed” and “imagined” within the institution. The study also demonstrates how these understandings inform (and limit) the cultural, social, and pedagogical practices of the institution. More broadly, Bianca’s research interests are in sociology of education, urban sociology, community based educational spaces, community and school partnerships, sociology of youth, urban schooling, critical pedagogy, race, class, and gender studies; youth literacy practices in urban contexts, youth activism; race poverty and achievement, and ethnographic and qualitative methodology. Some of her work has been published in the _Journal of Race, Ethnicity_, and _Education_ and the _Berkeley McNair Research Journal_.

In addition to her scholarly research interests, Bianca has been a community educator within out-of-school time community based programs for over ten years. Her experience as an instructor, curriculum developer, and consultant to community youth programs has informed her research in profound ways. She has worked with programs in Los Angeles and Oakland, California, and New York City, with organizations such as the Future Leaders of America, Compton Unified School District, Oakland All City Council, the New York City Lab School, and the Harlem Health Promotion Center. Bianca has also worked internationally with youth as a consultant for an international youth leadership forum in Aomori, Japan as well as a curriculum developer and consultant for youth centers established to educate youth about HIV/AIDS prevention in Johannesburg, South Africa.

While pursuing her doctorate degree, Bianca continues to work with youth regularly in community based and school settings, helping young people understand issues of race, ethnicity, gender, social class, and sexuality; leadership development, and develop critical media literacy skills. She has also worked as a consultant, providing staff development training for after school/out-of-school time programs. In addition to her work in community-based programs, she has been a lecturer at Teachers College, Columbia University and Hunter College.
