All of us (including me) can improve our writing. Share drafts with thoughtful readers, ask for feedback on what works and what could be better, and revise your prose, multiple times if needed. Trinity College supports this process through the First-Year Program and the <a href="http://www.trincoll.edu/Academics/centers/Writing/WritingCenter/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Writing Center</a>, where you can book an appointment with a trained associate to discuss your draft and revision strategies prior to the deadline. I also encourage students to <a title="Appointments & Advising" href="http://commons.trincoll.edu/jackdougherty/advising/" target="_blank">schedule a time to talk with me</a> about their writing process. In addition, explore these open-access online guides to college-level expository writing:
